<a id="welcome-to-the-project-blog-of-bootstrapify" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-the-project-blog-of-bootstrapify" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to the Project blog of Bootstrapify.</h1>

<p>This project will server two main purposes. </p>

<p>First, its a solution to a problem I often come across when building web applications with Ruby on Rails. I usually use Bootstrap themes for my projects, but trying to get those themes to play nice with the asset pipeline can be a pain sometimes, especially when deploying. I hope to mitigate most if not all of the pain surrounding that process. </p>

<p>Second, I will be experimenting with some different Project Management methodologies during the development of this gem. The initial development will be divided into two phases, with a third phase for continuous improvement. Phase one will be done using the linear "Waterfall" methodology. Here I will plan our the scope, cost, time, and quality requirements of the project, and develop a minimal viable product. As the final step of phase 1 and the waterfall method, the gem will be reviewed and verified. </p>

<p>That will lead us into phase two, during which I will be experimenting with the agile method known as EXtreme Programming. In this phase we will take feedback from the end of phase one, along with more feedback gained along the way, to organize our work into 3 or 4 iterations of development. It's during these iterations that we will continue to flesh our the gem, making it more versatile and robust. </p>

<p>Finally, in phase three we will open the repository to the public and encourage community participation. If you follow this blog and would like to contribute, this will be around the beginning of July 2015. Here we will use the GitHub issue tracking page to fix bugs and add features, as well as reviewing and integrating pull requests (which we love!). </p>

<p>During each phase I will be making posts here every week or so. I hope you follow us as we get this gem up and running in the next three months. And I can't wait for your contributions in July!</p>

<p>Your fellow developer,
Josh</p>
